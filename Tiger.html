                         <h3>About them</h3>
                         <p> The Sunda Island Tiger is one of the most critically endangered animals. There is estimated to be fewer than 400 tigers today. In the wild, a tiger's stripes are important for survival, as they act as camouflage, appearing as moving shadows in long grass and in trees.
                           Sunda tigers are losing their habitat and prey fast, and poaching is an ever-present threat. They used to live in Indonesia, Java, Bali and Sumatra. Now, the only living Sunda tigers are only found in Sumatra. Sumatra is located in Southeast Asia and is one of the Sunda Islands of western Indonesia. These tigers are a subspecies of Panthera tigris which means that they are smaller than
                           other tigers and have thick black stripes over their orange fur. They typically live in forests and swamps and weight anywhere from 165-308 pounds.

                         <h3>How did they become endangered?</h3>
                          <ul>
                              <li> Poaching which is illegal hunting, killing or capturing of animals happens a lot in Sumatra. These tigers are killed mainly for commercial gain. Poaching is responsible for about than 70% of tiger deaths which equal to about 40 tigers per year. </li>
                              <li> Habitat Loss: This forces animals to leave their protected areas and enter human occupied spaces which result in serious problems. When there is a human and tiger conflict, the vilagers have no choice but to kill the tigers when they have already hurt/wounded other people.</li>
                        </ul>

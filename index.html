            <h1 style="font-size: 80px; text-align: center">What is an Endagered Species?</h1> 
            <p style="text-align:center;"> The exact definition of Endagered Species: "A species considered to be facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild." Now species range from animals to fungi and they are all liable
                to fall into the endagered abyss. This has been a problem with our society for many years and we have made slow but steady progress to try and fix this issue. 
                Movements such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the World Wild Life Fund have been in the industry for some time now, the former being founded in 1948 and
                the latter in 1961. Having companies invest their lives into societal problems such as saving endagered species is what keeps the hope alive for the rest of us. Now All we need to do is our
                part to save these impertive species in our world. This is our <strong>call to action</strong>. My friends and I have decided that we are tired of sitting on the backline and so are you! To be apart of this 
                movement all you have to do is go through our website in its entirety and you'll feel like you're changing the world with us by the time you're done.</p>
